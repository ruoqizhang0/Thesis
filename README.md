# Master's Thesis: Optimal Cooling of Internally Heated Fluids

This thesis explores **the optimal cooling strategies** for internally heated fluids confined within **a horizontal strip**, as illustrated in the diagram below:

To optimize heat transfer, we employ **rotated Lorentz cone constraints (rcone)**, also known as **second-order cone constraints (SOCC)** and **a linear matrix inequality (LMI)**. Both rcone constraints and LMIs are well-defined finite-dimensional **convex constraints**, and optimization problems incorporating them fall under the category of **conic programs**.

A key focus of this work is investigating **the lower bound of heat transfer efficiency** as the **Péclet number (Pe)** increases. The Péclet number quantifies the relative strength of advection to diffusion in a flow system. The main result is depicted in the figure below:

The optimal lower bound on Pe (dotted line), is shown alongside the analytical bound (dash-dot line). The data have been compensated by Pe to facilitate direct comparison with the asymptotic scaling prediction.

It has been a rewarding experience to work on this project.
